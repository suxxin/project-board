# ü§©¬†Objective of Board Service Project

- Create clear functional requirements with materials that are easy for anyone to understand
- Experience a variety of documentation tasks to help implement the requirements
- Learn technical ways to actually implement project requirements with `Java + Spring Boot`
- Identify technology trends and discover new problems and solutions by using the latest version of technology
- Experience the entire development process from planning and documentation to development, configuration management, testing, and distribution

# üìÑ¬†Documentation to be used in this project

- `diagrams.net` (formerly draw.io)
    - Domain and ERD Design
    - Use Case
- `Google Sheet`
    - API Design
- `Git + GitHub`
    - Creating commit messages
    - managing projects and creating a collaborative environment
<details>
<summary>Documentation is IMPORTANT</summary>
<div markdown="1">

- Share the purpose, content and progress of the project through documentation (‚Äùwhy‚Äù is particularly important)
    - What, How: A Guide to work. Increase peer productivity
    - Why: Motivation to move together, colleagues can suggest better ways, or catch errors in my thoughts
- With more specific content, the better the project development is synchronized between co-workers
    - CAUTION - Excessive information flooding, confusion caused by unupdated or incorrect information
- Easy to back up
    - documents help you find what's in the past when you need to bring it up again
- Memory is short and distorted, but documents are modifiable, evolving, and durable
- Keeping a business record reveals business progress and my performance

# üìç¬†Purpose

> to solve customer's problems (+ to study the process)
> 
- Organize customer needs and issues
    - Developments that customers don't want or can't solve their problems are meaningless
- **Study** objective - somewhat freely in this area (failure is acceptable)
- Issue ‚Üí Requirements ‚Üí Derive features ‚Üí Implementation plan ‚Üí Development plan ‚Üí Implementation
- Perks of Study Goals: Use the latest version of technology as much as possible
    - Keep up with the latest
    - Experience issues that have not yet been identified ‚Üí find a solution ‚Üí solve them if you can
    

# üôãüèª¬†Development Tools

- IDE: `IntelliJ IDEA 2022.1.1` (Community Edition)
- Language: `JAVA 17`
- Framework: `Spring Boot 2.7.0`
- Build Tool: `Gradle 7.4.1`
- git GUI: `GitKraken`

<aside>
‚òùüèª Experience implementation of various development strategies, domain design, practical design patterns, and business logic

# üß™¬†Test and Deployment

> The moment you show the product to the customer and see the performance
> 
- Test
    - Are all development requirements implemented (work done)?
    - Does the implemented requirement work without errors?
    - `JUnit 5.8.2`, `Mockito`, `AssertJ`
    - `Spring Boot Slice Test Technique`
    - `Github`: Automate Test/Build
- Deployment
    - Creating a GitHub Release
    - Deploy to Cloud Servers (`Heroku`)
    - `Github`: Automate Heroku deployment
